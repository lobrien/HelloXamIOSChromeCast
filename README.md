# Hello, ChromeCast from Xamarin.iOS

Scans for an attached [ChromeCast](https://developers.google.com/cast/), creates and closes a session, outputs some strings on lifecycle events.

Requires a Xamarin iOS binding for ChromeCast, which I'll make available soon. Just putting this up to give a sense of how easy it is.
